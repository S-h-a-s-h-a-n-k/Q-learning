# DQN
- This includes some basics of [GYM](https://gym.openai.com/) library of python.<br /> 
- Q Learning algorithm is used on two environments of gym, [taxi](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Taxi-v3/) and [frozenlake](https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake8x8-v0/). For frozenlaka an inovative approach is introduced  for Q-learning to learn faster. 
- DQN is applied on CartPole environment for illustration, this can also be put in use for other discrete action-space and continuous state-space environments.
